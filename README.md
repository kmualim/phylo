# Multiple sequence alignment utilizing machine learning

This repository contains the scripts written to solve the multiple sequence alignment problem via a crowd-sourcing human computing platform - [Phylo](https://phylo.cs.mcgill.ca) 
Data obtained was extracted from this platform. 

## Results Intepretation

An alignment comparison was made between a classic progressive algorithm and a sequence alignment heuristic like TCoffee, with no clear 
conclusion or correlation between sequence features (eg. length, GC content, size) and how well either algorithms performed.
